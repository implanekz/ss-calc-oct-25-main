# Building the Bridge: Enhancements

## The Calculation Machine

Social Security is not an investment or a risk; it's a big calculation machine.

Press the right buttons and you get more money. Press the wrong buttons and you get less money.

This isn't a loophole. This isn't a gotcha. This isn't shady.

This is how the system works. It was designed this way.

It was designed to give you maximum income at 70 and a crippled income at 62.

That is the built-in incentive here.

All you have to do is accept that reality and use it to your own benefit.

But you need to see the results in advance, right? Seeing is believing!

**Let's go to the app!**

You need to know which buttons to push.

But how much are those buttons worth to me, you wonder?

And what does my life look like during this period?

## The Reality of Filing Early

The reality is that most people file at 62 and leave hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table … unknowingly and unnecessarily.

They are fighting the system, not going with it.

As a result, they end up with a highly crippled age 62 Social Security benefit.

In fact, it's so crippled that they will never be able to pay their bills with such a reduced amount. Even now at 62.

**Especially now at 62!!**

So they're destined to have to "build a bridge" from 62 to 70 anyway.

Except … with that crippled income around their neck for life like an albatross … it's not a bridge to 70, it's a rickety bridge to the end of their lives.

They'll never get rid of it.

## The Smart Alternative

So if you have to build that bridge anyway, why not have a pot of gold at the other side?

This new app enhancement shows you how to get there one micro-commitment at a time.

One month at a time.

And it will calculate exactly how much more you're going to get at the end of one more month.

And then after you say, "Okay, I can wait that one more month."

Then the next month presents itself with the same calculation and option.

Will you wait one more month after that? Probably.

And then when the whole thing is getting tedious, you get to age 67, maybe think you don't want to play this game anymore.

But that's when the delayed retirement credits kick in.

You get an extra 8% increase plus inflation from age 67 until you're 68.

And it happens again until you're 69.

And then it happens again until you're 70.

In total, with 3% inflation per year, that comes out to a 37% increase from 67 to 70.

Now you're really getting juiced and excited. Along with all the other possibilities involved in building a bridge from 62 to 70.

Not the least of which is you can always see the light at the end of the tunnel.

## The Delayed Retirement Credit Acceleration

When users reach Full Retirement Age (typically 67), they should understand that the returns accelerate dramatically:

- **Before FRA (62-67)**: Benefits increase gradually to reach full retirement benefit
- **After FRA (67-70)**: Delayed Retirement Credits provide 8% annual increase PLUS inflation adjustments
- **Combined effect**: Approximately 37% total increase from age 67 to 70 (with 3% annual inflation)

This creates a powerful incentive to continue waiting, especially once you've already made it to 67. The "home stretch" becomes the most rewarding period.

The visual representation in the app should highlight this transition point, showing users when they cross into the DRC zone where their patience pays off even more handsomely.
