### üé• The RISE & SHINE Method‚Ñ¢
**A Framework for a Secure, Purpose-Driven Retirement**

---

**[Opening shot: soft music, warm lighting, camera on you.]**

"For most Americans, Social Security isn't just part of their retirement plan ‚Äî it is their retirement plan."

I spent twenty-five years as a fiduciary advisor, helping people plan for the day their paycheck stopped.
And even now, at seventy-two, after letting my licenses go, I still see the same quiet fear in people standing on the edge of retirement.

A few months ago, I met a couple in their early sixties.
They'd done everything right ‚Äî worked hard, saved what they could, stayed out of debt.
But when we ran the numbers, it became painfully clear: they were about to make a decision that would lock them into a smaller income for the rest of their lives.
They were ready to file for Social Security at sixty-two ‚Äî because that's what everyone around them was doing.

And that's when it hit me again‚Ä¶

There are really three kinds of people when it comes to retirement planning.

There are those with all the right things in all the wrong places.
Those with some of the right things in some of the right places.
And those with none of the right things ‚Äî and not much time left to get them there.

Now, you might be thinking, "What about the people with all the right things in all the right places?"

I didn't forget them.

They're the top ten percent.
They're fine.
They're not my mission.

My mission is to help the ninety percent ‚Äî the people doing their best, working hard, but one decision away from either freedom or frustration in retirement.

And that's exactly where the RISE & SHINE Method‚Ñ¢ comes in ‚Äî a way to move from impulse to empowerment by aligning emotion and logic in the right order.

---

### üéØ The Mission: A Retirement Rescue for the 90 Percent

Half of adults over fifty-five have little or no retirement savings.
Those who do have a median of around two-hundred-thousand dollars ‚Äî which, under the old "four-percent rule," produces only about eight-thousand dollars a year.

So the question "When should I claim Social Security?" isn't about optimization; it's about survival.

Taking benefits early feels emotionally safe ‚Äî but in reality, it can quietly cost hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime.

The RISE & SHINE Method‚Ñ¢ helps people reframe that choice: not as giving something up, but as gaining long-term security, freedom, and peace of mind.

---

### üß≠ The Core Idea: Timing, Combining & Sequencing

Most financial advice starts with spreadsheets.
But life doesn't happen in spreadsheets.

People make decisions with emotion and then justify them with logic.
So if we want better outcomes, we have to get the sequence right.

That's why this framework starts with RISE ‚Äî the emotional journey ‚Äî and only then moves to SHINE ‚Äî the logical implementation.

Together, they bridge the gap between how we feel and what we do.
Because when you change the order, you change the outcome.

---

### üí° Results-in-Advance: Seeing Your Future Before You

Traditional calculators talk about the so-called "breakeven point."
When will I get my money back?

It's a lifeless question.

Instead, the RISE & SHINE approach lets you see your future ‚Äî side by side.
Claiming at sixty-two versus waiting until seventy.

The difference?
Often more than a million dollars in lifetime income.

And when people see that ‚Äî visually, graphically, in color ‚Äî it clicks.
Waiting isn't delay; it's design.
It's not about denial; it's about direction.

You stop thinking, "What am I missing out on today?"
and start asking, "What am I building for tomorrow?"

That's results-in-advance: helping your future self send a thank-you note to your present self.

---

### üß¨ The Life Expectancy Myth ‚Äî and the Hidden Gift

**[Visual: Fade in the chart titled "Lifespan Reality: Life Expectancy After Reaching Age 65." Music softens.]**

You know, there's one more big objection I hear all the time.
And it usually comes right when someone's 62 and emotionally ready to retire.

They say, "I'm not going to live that long."

And honestly‚Ä¶ I get it.
We've all seen those headlines about "average life expectancy being 78."
And it's easy to anchor your entire plan on that number.

But here's the thing ‚Äî that number includes everyone, even those who never make it to 65.

If you've reached 65 in reasonably good health, you've already beaten the averages.

For men who reach 65, the average life expectancy is nearly 85.
For women, it's almost 88.
And for couples, there's a 50% chance that one of you will live past 92.

So when someone says, "I probably won't live that long,"
what they're really doing is planning their future based on averages that no longer apply to them.

And here's the twist:

In many marriages, the husband is a few years older ‚Äî and statistically more likely to pass away first.
He's also often the one with the larger Social Security benefit.

So when he delays his claim ‚Äî maximizing that benefit ‚Äî
he's not just helping himself.
He's protecting his spouse.

Because after he's gone, that higher benefit automatically becomes her survivor benefit.
It's her guaranteed income for life.

Delaying isn't selfish.
It's love ‚Äî expressed in numbers.

So when I hear, "I'm not going to live that long,"
I often reply, "Maybe not ‚Äî but she might."

And that single mindset shift changes everything.

The longer you live, the more valuable your patience becomes.
And if you don't, your decision still protects the person you love most.

This isn't about optimism ‚Äî it's about responsibility.
Because the best legacy you can leave isn't just memories‚Ä¶ it's security.

### üï∞ Understanding the Three Phases of Retirement

Retirement isn't one long stretch of life; it's three distinct chapters.

**The Go-Go Years (60-78):**
You're active, curious, mobile. It's the time to explore, experiment, and build the bridge to your future income.

**The Slow-Go Years (79-88):**
Energy tapers, but independence remains. This is when higher guaranteed income keeps life comfortable and reduces financial anxiety.

**The No-Go Years (89 and beyond):**
Health challenges often rise, and Social Security becomes the difference between dignity and dependence.

You build the bridge in your Go-Go Years so you can cross it safely in your Slow-Go and No-Go Years.

---

### ‚òÄÔ∏è The Dual Framework: RISE and SHINE

T.S. Eliot once wrote, "Between the impulse and the action falls the shadow."
That's where most retirement mistakes live ‚Äî in that shadow of fear and impatience.

The RISE & SHINE Method‚Ñ¢ helps you walk through that shadow.

---

### üåÖ RISE ‚Äî The Emotional Journey

**Stage 1: Reality** ‚Äî Acknowledge the shared fear. Nearly every retiree worries about running out of money.
Facing that truth isn't failure; it's strength.

**Stage 2: Impulse** ‚Äî Recognize the urge to grab benefits early. It's the adult version of the marshmallow experiment ‚Äî instant comfort versus lasting reward.

**Stage 3: Strategy** ‚Äî You don't have to choose between retiring now or having security later.
You can design a hybrid retirement ‚Äî part work, part freedom ‚Äî and still delay claiming until seventy.

**Stage 4: Execute** ‚Äî The moment of commitment. With clarity and confidence, you choose to wait ‚Äî not from fear, but from foresight.

---

### ‚ú® SHINE ‚Äî The Logical Implementation

Once the emotions are steady, it's time for systems.

**Stage 1: Strategy** ‚Äî This is where vision meets numbers. Using the Social Security Maximization Calculator, you can see your path ‚Äî often a seven-figure improvement by age 95.

**Stage 2: Hybrid Income** ‚Äî Design your Go-Go Years around flexible, meaningful work ‚Äî consulting, creative projects, mentoring, part-time roles.
These years fund the bridge to seventy.

**Stage 3: Navigate** ‚Äî Life changes, markets shift. Revisit the plan regularly. Small adjustments now prevent major detours later.

**Stage 4: Execute** ‚Äî Finally, file at the optimal age ‚Äî typically seventy ‚Äî and secure the highest guaranteed lifetime income available to you.
That's the moment strategy becomes reality.

---

### üåÑ Conclusion: From Impulse to Empowerment

The RISE & SHINE Method‚Ñ¢ isn't just a financial framework; it's a rescue mission for your future self.

Because at its heart, this isn't about money.
It's about agency.
It's about turning the fear of "what if" into the confidence of "I've got this."

By starting with emotion (RISE), aligning with logic (SHINE), and sequencing the two correctly, you move from reaction to intention ‚Äî from the shadow to the light.

You build a bridge not just to more income, but to more peace.

And when you reach your later years ‚Äî the Slow-Go and No-Go years ‚Äî you'll look back and realize something powerful:

Waiting wasn't a delay.
It was a decision.
An investment in dignity, independence, and the calm of knowing you did it right.

**[Soft outro music rises.]**

"Because your 85-year-old self will thank your 62-year-old self for what you chose to do today."

#### The Complete RISE and SHINE Story

**The Crisis:**
- 50% of people 55+ have little to no retirement savings
- Average Social Security: $4,767/month
- Maximum possible: $16,666/month
- The gap: $11,899/month = $1.6M over lifetime

2. **Impulse** - Recognize the pull to claim early (adult marshmallow test)
3. **Strategy** - Discover you can have both: retire AND maximize benefits
4. **Execute** - Commit to waiting until 70 with confidence

**The Implementation - SHINE:**

4. **Navigate** - Stay on course month by month
5. **Execute** - File at 70 for maximum lifetime benefits

**The Three Retirement Phases:**
