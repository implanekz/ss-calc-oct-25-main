# RAG Content for The RISE and SHINE Method™

This directory contains educational content and frameworks to be used by the chatbot for providing guidance and context to users.

## Purpose

These documents provide the foundational philosophy, methodology, and messaging that should inform:
1. Chatbot responses and guidance
2. UI/UX design decisions
3. Educational content throughout the platform
4. Feature development priorities

## Documents

### [rise-and-shine-method.md](./rise-and-shine-method.md)
**The RISE and SHINE Method™: A Framework for a Secure Retirement**

The core philosophical framework that underpins the entire platform. This document explains:
- The dual-framework approach (emotional RISE, logical SHINE)
- The three phases of retirement (go-go, slow-go, no-go years)
- Results-in-advance concept
- Step-by-step journey from impulse to empowerment

**Key concepts for chatbot:**
- RISE stages: Reality → Impulse → Strategy → Execute
- SHINE stages: Strategy → Hybrid → Income → Navigate → Execute
- Emphasis on timing, combining, and sequencing
- The importance of addressing emotions before logic

### [why-social-security-matters.md](./why-social-security-matters.md)
**Why Focus on Social Security?**

Explains the foundational importance of Social Security optimization in retirement planning.

**Key messages:**
- Social Security is THE most important financial decision for those over 55
- It's the foundation, not just a piece, of retirement planning
- Users can control this decision and see results in advance
- 12.4% of every paycheck has been set aside for this benefit
- The system was designed to reward waiting until 70

**Use cases:**
- When users question why we emphasize Social Security so heavily
- When explaining the difference between guaranteed income and uncertain investments
- When users need motivation to delay claiming

### [building-the-bridge.md](./building-the-bridge.md)
**Building the Bridge: Practical Messaging**

Practical, persuasive messaging about the mechanics and incentives of the Social Security system.

**Key concepts:**
- Social Security as a "calculation machine" - press right buttons, get more money
- The reality that filing at 62 creates a "crippled" benefit
- Building a bridge from 62 to 70 is inevitable - why not have a pot of gold at the end?
- One month at a time approach (micro-commitments)
- Delayed Retirement Credits acceleration at FRA (37% increase from 67-70)

**Use cases:**
- When explaining the mechanics of how Social Security works
- When users are considering filing at 62
- When introducing the "one month at a time" feature
- When explaining Delayed Retirement Credits

### [kind-gap-framework.md](./kind-gap-framework.md)
**The K.I.N.D. Gap Framework**

Strategic framework explaining the four gaps preventing benefit maximization and how to close them.

**The Four Gaps:**
- **Knowledge Gap:** What you think you know vs. what you need to know
- **Income Gap:** $4,767/month (average) vs. $16,666/month (maximum) = $1.6M over lifetime
- **Navigation Gap:** What you're doing with go-go years vs. what you could be doing
- **Decision Gap:** Planning "someday" vs. optimizing today

**Key messaging:**
- "More Income, Better Outcome"
- "Close the gap, capture the gain"
- Maps K.I.N.D. gaps to RISE and SHINE stages
- Provides objection handling for common concerns

**Use cases:**
- When explaining the platform's value proposition
- When addressing user objections or hesitation
- When creating urgency for action
- When demonstrating the cost of inaction

## Integration with Features

### Connection to One Month at a Time Modal
The messaging in `building-the-bridge.md` directly informs the [One Month at a Time feature](../features/one-month-at-a-time-modal.md), particularly:
- Micro-commitment philosophy
- Visual demonstration of DRC acceleration
- Breaking down 8 years into 96 achievable monthly decisions

### Connection to Main Calculators
The RISE and SHINE Method™ should inform:
- Flow and structure of all calculators
- Educational tooltips and help text
- Result presentation (emphasizing results-in-advance)
- User journey from emotional resistance to logical commitment

## Usage Guidelines for Chatbot

When responding to user questions, the chatbot should:

1. **Lead with emotion, follow with logic** (RISE then SHINE principle)
2. **Use results-in-advance** - show specific numbers and visual comparisons
3. **Acknowledge reality** - validate fears about running out of money
4. **Address the impulse** - understand the desire to claim at 62
5. **Present strategy** - show there's a better way (hybrid retirement)
6. **Guide to execution** - help users commit to optimal strategy

### Response Patterns

**When user expresses desire to claim early:**
- Start with Reality stage: validate the fear/concern
- Move to Impulse stage: acknowledge the emotional pull
- Present Strategy stage: show there's another way
- Offer Execute stage: help them commit to waiting

**When user asks "why wait?":**
- Reference the "calculation machine" concept
- Show dramatic before/after comparisons
- Emphasize this is how the system was designed
- Highlight the DRC acceleration after FRA

**When user feels overwhelmed:**
- Break it down: "one month at a time"
- Show incremental gains
- Reference the go-go years strategy
- Make 8 years feel achievable through micro-commitments
