# Why Are We Focusing So Heavily on Social Security?

## The Most Important Financial Decision of Your Life

Why is your Social Security timing decision emphasized in such a specific way?

Isn't it just one part of the larger retirement picture covered in other apps?

In the context of "doing the right things" (strategy) and then "doing things right" (tactics), Social Security is the ultimate choice of doing the right thing.

**It is the foundation of your retirement financial plan.**

Let me say that again.

The truth is, this is the most important financial decision you or anyone over 55 will make for the rest of their lives.

The leverage you gain from this decision will have the most significant financial impact most people will experience in retirement.

Choosing when to file for Social Security benefits will change everything — for better or worse.

Your choice.

This is the one aspect you can control and see the results of in advance.

It's up to you.

The system is designed this way, and it's your job to take advantage of it.

Once you make this decision, we can easily move into tracking other parts of your financial future in Projection Lab.

But once we do that, we're stepping into the world of predicting an uncertain future, full of risks and unpredictable outcomes.

We can't predict those outcomes with absolute certainty, but we can prepare for them.

However, with a solid income base because of Social Security, you'll know what your safety net looks like.

You'll understand how much of your future retirement expenses will be covered by guaranteed monthly income.

## Your Secret Store of Wealth

You have a secret store of wealth waiting for you in retirement.

It's the savings plan you've been working hard on and contributing to all your life.

It's still there, still waiting.

Curious?

Social Security is an untouchable store of your future wealth.

In fact, there's enough future wealth that Social Security can support a significant percentage—and for many, a large percentage—of your living expenses throughout retirement.

We show you how much in the "Flow" tab of the app.

Your Social Security was funded by you through your FICA taxes withheld from every paycheck you've received in your lifetime.

And then on top of that, you got an employer match of 100% from your (i.e., the employee's) own contribution.

Add it up, and that's 12.4% of every paycheck that you've put aside for your retirement.

No one can touch it — not even you! — until you choose to begin benefits, typically sometime between 62 and 70.

In the meantime, Social Security grows your contributions and the matching contributions of your employers by investing in U.S. government bonds.

It gets adjusted for inflation along the way.

The benefit begins to "ripen" at age 62, but doesn't reach its full juicy goodness until age 70.

This isn't a bug in the system, it's a feature. It was designed this way.

The incentive to delay and get 77% more money every month for the rest of your life is intentional.

So, why do most people do just the opposite?

Because they've never seen the math, and the math is in their favor.

Let's go to the app.
