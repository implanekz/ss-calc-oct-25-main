# Feature Specifications

This directory contains detailed specifications for features to be implemented in The RISE and SHINE Method™ platform.

## Overview

Feature specifications document the technical requirements, user experience goals, and implementation details for new platform capabilities. Each specification should include:

- Feature overview and purpose
- User experience design
- Technical requirements
- Success metrics
- Connection to platform philosophy (RISE and SHINE Method™)

## Current Features

### [one-month-at-a-time-modal.md](./one-month-at-a-time-modal.md)
**One Month at a Time Modal**

An interactive feature that demonstrates the incremental value of delaying Social Security benefits month-by-month.

**Key capabilities:**
- Month-by-month progression from age 62 to 70
- Visual three-bar chart showing age 62, current selection, and age 70 benefits
- Real-time calculation of incremental monthly gains
- Running cumulative lifetime benefit total
- Sankey diagram animation showing actual vs. potential gains
- Special highlighting of Full Retirement Age (FRA) when Delayed Retirement Credits begin
- Support for single and married scenarios
- Extension to widowed and divorced calculators

**Philosophy connection:**
Directly implements the RISE and SHINE Method™ Navigate stage, making the abstract concept of "waiting 8 years" into 96 achievable micro-commitments.

## Feature Development Guidelines

When creating new feature specifications, ensure they:

1. **Align with RISE and SHINE Method™**
   - Support the emotional journey (RISE) and/or logical implementation (SHINE)
   - Consider which stage(s) of the framework the feature supports

2. **Emphasize Results-in-Advance**
   - Show users concrete outcomes before they commit
   - Use dramatic visual comparisons
   - Focus on lifetime cumulative benefits, not "breakeven"

3. **Support Micro-Commitments**
   - Break large decisions into smaller, achievable steps
   - Provide immediate feedback on each decision
   - Build momentum through visible progress

4. **Address the Three Retirement Phases**
   - Go-Go Years (60-78): Active planning and bridge building
   - Slow-Go Years (79-88): Increased importance of guaranteed income
   - No-Go Years (89+): Critical reliance on maximum Social Security

5. **Consider All User Scenarios**
   - Single filers
   - Married couples (including age differences)
   - Widowed individuals
   - Divorced individuals
   - Already filed scenarios

## Feature Request Process

When proposing a new feature:

1. **Define the Problem**
   - What user need or pain point does this address?
   - How does it relate to Social Security optimization?

2. **Propose the Solution**
   - How does the feature work?
   - What is the user experience?
   - What are the technical requirements?

3. **Connect to Philosophy**
   - How does this support the RISE and SHINE framework?
   - Which stage(s) does it primarily support?
   - Does it provide results-in-advance?

4. **Define Success**
   - What metrics indicate the feature is successful?
   - How will user behavior change?
   - What impact on filing decisions is expected?

## Implementation Priority

Features should be prioritized based on:

1. **Impact on optimal filing decisions** - Does it help users choose better filing strategies?
2. **Alignment with RISE and SHINE** - Does it support the core framework?
3. **User engagement** - Will it increase user interaction and understanding?
4. **Technical feasibility** - Can it be implemented with existing infrastructure?
5. **Educational value** - Does it teach users about Social Security mechanics?

## Testing Requirements

All features should be tested for:

- **Calculation accuracy** - Verify all Social Security benefit calculations
- **User experience** - Ensure intuitive, clear interface
- **Edge cases** - Handle unusual scenarios (large age differences, early/late filing, etc.)
- **Performance** - Smooth operation even with complex calculations
- **Accessibility** - Usable by all user types
- **Mobile responsiveness** - Works on all device sizes

## Maintenance

Feature specifications should be:
- Updated when implementation details change
- Referenced during development
- Used for onboarding new developers
- Kept in sync with actual implementation
- Reviewed periodically for accuracy

## Questions or Suggestions

For questions about feature specifications or to propose new features, ensure alignment with:
- Platform philosophy (RISE and SHINE Method™)
- Existing feature set
- Technical architecture
- User experience principles
