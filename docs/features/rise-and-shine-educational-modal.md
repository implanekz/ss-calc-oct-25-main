```
frontend/src/components/
  RiseAndShineModal.jsx          # Main modal component

  defaultTab="video" | "learn" | "podcast"
/>
```

### State Management
- Track current tab
- Track video/audio playback progress
- Remember user's last position (localStorage)
- Track completion status for gamification

### Responsive Design
- Desktop: Large modal (80% viewport width)
- Tablet: Full-screen modal
- Mobile: Full-screen modal with stacked content

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load video and audio files
- Only load active tab content
- Optimize video for web (compressed, multiple quality options)
- Use video thumbnail/poster until play
- Cache content in localStorage after first load

## User Experience Flow

### Discovery
1. User lands on platform
2. Sees "Learn RISE & SHINE" in menu
3. Clicks to open modal

### Engagement
1. Modal opens to Video tab by default (first-time users)
2. Returning users see their last viewed tab
3. User can switch between tabs freely
4. Progress is saved automatically

### Completion Tracking (Optional)
- Mark video as "watched" after 80% viewed
- Mark content as "read" after scrolling to bottom
- Mark podcast as "listened" after 80% played
- Award badge or unlock feature after consuming all three

### Sharing
- Share button generates link directly to this modal
- Can specify which tab to open
- Useful for onboarding emails, marketing, etc.

## Content Updates

### Version Control
- Content version number tracked
- Notify users of updated content
- "What's New" indicator if content updated since last view

### Update Process
1. Update markdown source files in `docs/rag/`
2. Regenerate NotebookLM podcast if needed
3. Re-record video if major changes
4. Update content.json file
5. Increment version number
