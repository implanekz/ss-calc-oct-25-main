# PIA Calculator - Phase 2: XML Upload Feature âœ… COMPLETE

## Overview

Phase 2 adds XML upload functionality to the PIA Calculator, allowing users to upload their Social Security earnings statement directly from SSA.gov and automatically populate their earnings history.

## Features Implemented

### Frontend (PIACalculator.jsx)

**New State Variables:**
- `isUploadingXML` - Track upload progress
- `xmlUploadSuccess` - Success message after upload
- `statementDate` - Date the XML statement was generated
- `personInfo` - Person details from XML (name, SSN, birth date)

**New UI Section:**
- **XML Upload widget** with purple gradient styling
- File input accepting `.xml` files only
- Loading spinner during upload
- Success message showing:
  - Number of years loaded
  - Statement date
  - Person's name
- Instructions on how to download XML from SSA.gov
- Auto-calculates PIA after successful upload

**Upload Handler (`handleXMLUpload`):**
1. Uploads XML file to `/upload-ssa-xml` endpoint
2. Extracts person info and updates birth year
3. Updates SSA PIA from XML if available
4. Maps earnings data to spreadsheet
5. Auto-triggers PIA calculation after 500ms

### Backend (ssa_xml_processor.py)

**Fixed Issues:**
- `person_info` now stored as instance variable (`self.person_info`)
- Added `total_years` to parse results
- Returns complete person info in parse results

**XML Structure Supported:**
```xml
<SSAStatement>
    <StatementDate>2024-10-01</StatementDate>
    <PersonInfo>
        <Name>John Smith</Name>
        <SSN>123-45-6789</SSN>
        <BirthDate>1960-05-15</BirthDate>
        <EstimatedPIA>2100</EstimatedPIA>
    </PersonInfo>
    <EarningsHistory>
        <EarningsRecord>
            <Year>1978</Year>
            <Earnings>8500</Earnings>
        </EarningsRecord>
        <!-- ... more records ... -->
    </EarningsHistory>
</SSAStatement>
```

### Backend API (integrated_ss_api.py)

**Updated `/upload-ssa-xml` Endpoint:**
- Fixed: No longer references non-existent `create_calculator_from_earnings` method
- Directly calls `calculate_aime_and_pia()` for PIA calculation
- Sets `birth_year` on processor for proper wage indexing
- Generates simple recommendations based on zero years and total years
- Returns `XMLAnalysisResponse` with:
  - Person info (name, SSN, birth date, statement date)
  - Earnings summary (total years, zero years, highest year)
  - Calculated PIA
  - Editable spreadsheet data
  - Optimization recommendations

## Testing

**Sample XML File Created:**
- Location: `backend/sample_ssa_statement.xml`
- Profile: 47 years of earnings (1978-2024)
- 3 zero years (1983, 2002-2003)
- Career progression from $8,500 to $185,000
- Calculated PIA: **$2,847.77/month**

**Test Results:**
```bash
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/upload-ssa-xml \
  -F file=@backend/sample_ssa_statement.xml
```

âœ… Success! Returns:
- Person: John Smith, born 1960-05-15
- Statement date: 2024-10-01
- 47 years of earnings data
- PIA calculated: $2,847.77
- Complete spreadsheet with wage-indexed values

## User Flow

1. **Navigate** to PIA Calculator tab (ðŸ§® icon)
2. **Enter** birth year (auto-populated from XML if uploaded)
3. **Upload** XML file:
   - Click "Choose File" button
   - Select `.xml` file downloaded from SSA.gov
   - Wait for processing (spinner shows)
4. **Review** success message:
   - See years loaded
   - Verify statement date is recent
   - Check person name matches
5. **Automatic** PIA calculation triggers
6. **View** results:
   - Calculated PIA vs SSA PIA comparison
   - Full earnings spreadsheet (editable)
   - Detailed breakdown (AIME, bend points)
7. **Edit** future projections as needed
8. **Recalculate** to see impact of changes

## Key Benefits

âœ… **No Manual Entry** - Upload 40+ years of earnings in seconds
âœ… **Accurate Data** - Direct from SSA records
âœ… **Statement Date Tracking** - Know when data was generated
âœ… **Auto-Populated** - Birth year, name, earnings all extracted
âœ… **Instant Calculation** - PIA computed immediately after upload
âœ… **Editable** - Can modify projections and recalculate
âœ… **Professional UX** - Clear feedback, loading states, success messages

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

- [ ] Add "Re-upload XML" feature to detect newer statements
- [ ] Implement XML merge logic (preserve future projections)
- [ ] Add "Export to CSV" for edited spreadsheet
- [ ] Create comparison view (original XML PIA vs edited scenario)
- [ ] Add visualization: Earnings history chart with zero years highlighted
- [ ] Implement "What-if" scenarios with side-by-side comparison

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/components/PIACalculator.jsx` - Added XML upload UI and handler

### Backend
- `backend/core/ssa_xml_processor.py` - Fixed person_info storage, added total_years
- `backend/core/integrated_ss_api.py` - Fixed endpoint to use calculate_aime_and_pia()

### Testing
- `backend/sample_ssa_statement.xml` - Created realistic sample for testing

## How to Get SSA XML

1. Visit https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Navigate to "Earnings Record"
4. Look for "Download" or "Export" option
5. Select XML format (if available)
6. Save file to your computer
7. Upload to PIA Calculator

**Note:** SSA.gov may not offer XML export for all users. If unavailable, users can manually enter earnings from their paper statement or use the profile generator for testing scenarios.
