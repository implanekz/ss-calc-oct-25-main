```

**Key Insight:** Despite some $150K+ years, the lean years (1997, 2001, 2008-09, 2020) pull down the average significantly. PIA won't be as high as they expect.

---

## Profile 2: Teacher (Consistent, Modest Growth)
**Birth Year:** 1963
**Occupation:** Public school teacher
**Pattern:** Steady progression, summers off (not SS covered)
**Target PIA:** ~$1,650/month

### The Story:
Started teaching at 23, took 3 years off for children, returned part-time, went full-time after kids in school. Consistent salary steps, maxes out around $75K.

### Earnings History:
```
1986: $22,000    # First year teaching
1987: $24,000
1988: $26,000
1989: $28,000
1990: $30,000

1995: $18,000    # Part-time substitute

1998: $37,000
1999: $39,000
2000: $41,000
2001: $43,000
2002: $45,000
2003: $47,000
2004: $49,000
2005: $51,000
2006: $53,000
2007: $55,000
2008: $57,000

2011: $63,000
2012: $65,000
2013: $67,000
2014: $69,000
2015: $71,000
2016: $73,000
2017: $75,000    # Topped out
2018: $75,000
2019: $75,000
2020: $75,000
2021: $75,000
2022: $75,000
2023: $75,000
2024: $75,000
2025: $75,000
```

**Key Insight:** The 3-year gap (1992-1994) means those zeros are in the top 35. Plus modest salary means PIA is lower than middle-class lifestyle suggests. Many teachers are surprised by this.

---

## Profile 3: Entrepreneur (Failed First, Succeeded Later)
**Birth Year:** 1965
**Occupation:** Tech startup founder
**Pattern:** Corporate → Failed startup (zeros) → Successful startup (big exit) → Consulting
**Target PIA:** ~$2,800/month

### The Story:
Worked at Microsoft, left to start company at 32, bootstrapped for 4 years (paid themselves minimally), company failed, went back to corporate, tried again at 42, sold company at 49, now consulting.

### Earnings History:
```
1987: $35,000    # Microsoft
1988: $45,000
1989: $55,000
1990: $65,000
1991: $75,000
1992: $85,000
1993: $95,000
1994: $105,000
1995: $115,000
1996: $125,000
1997: $15,000    # Left for startup - paid themselves peanuts
1998: $18,000    # Bootstrap mode
1999: $20,000    # Running out of savings
2000: $0         # Startup failed, regrouping
2001: $0         # Job hunting during dot-com crash
2002: $85,000    # Got corporate job again
2003: $95,000
2004: $105,000
2005: $115,000
2006: $125,000
2007: $25,000    # Left again for startup #2
2008: $30,000    # Building
2009: $35,000    # Getting traction
2010: $50,000    # Revenue coming in
2011: $75,000    # Paying themselves more
2012: $100,000
2013: $150,000
2014: $200,000   # Company profitable (above max)
2015: $250,000   # Great year (above max)
2016: $300,000   # Acquisition year! (above max)
2017: $180,000   # Consulting
2018: $190,000
2019: $200,000
2020: $150,000   # COVID slowdown
2021: $200,000
2022: $210,000
```

**Key Insight:** Despite the big exit years (2014-2016), the zeros from failed attempts (1997-2001, 2007) drag down the average. Those early struggles have a permanent impact on Social Security.

## Profile 4: Late Career Pivot (Corporate Lawyer → Nonprofit)
**Birth Year:** 1964
**Occupation:** Corporate lawyer → nonprofit executive director
**Pattern:** High earnings → voluntary pay cut for mission work
**Target PIA:** ~$2,600/month

### The Story:
BigLaw partner making $300K+, burned out at 48, took nonprofit job at $95K, much happier but took a huge pay cut.

### Earnings History:
```
1986: $45,000    # Law firm associate
1987: $50,000
1988: $55,000
1989: $60,000
1990: $65,000
1991: $70,000
1992: $85,000    # Made partner track
1993: $100,000
1994: $120,000
1995: $140,000
1996: $160,000
1997: $180,000
1998: $200,000   # Partner
1999: $220,000
2000: $240,000
2001: $260,000
2002: $280,000
2003: $300,000
2004: $320,000
2005: $340,000   # All above SS max taxable
2006: $360,000
2007: $380,000
2008: $400,000
2009: $420,000
2010: $440,000
2011: $460,000
2012: $95,000    # Left for nonprofit! (huge cut)
2013: $98,000
2014: $100,000
2015: $102,000
2016: $105,000
2017: $108,000
2018: $110,000
2019: $113,000
2020: $115,000
2021: $118,000
2022: $120,000
```

**Key Insight:** First 26 years maxed out SS taxable wages (great!), but last 10+ years at nonprofit don't improve PIA at all - they're replacing those high-earning years with lower ones in the top 35 calculation. The mission work feels good but actually *lowers* their Social Security benefit slightly.

## Profile 5: Stay-at-Home Parent Returning to Workforce
**Birth Year:** 1966
**Occupation:** Accountant → Stay home 15 years → Back to work
**Pattern:** Early career → Long gap → Late restart
**Target PIA:** ~$1,400/month

### The Story:
Worked as CPA for 8 years, had kids, stayed home for 15 years, returned to workforce at 50 part-time, now 57 wondering about retirement.

### Earnings History:
```
1988: $28,000    # First CPA job
1989: $32,000
1990: $36,000
1991: $40,000
1992: $44,000
1993: $48,000
1994: $52,000
1995: $56,000
1996: $0         # First child, quit job
1997: $0
1998: $0
1999: $0
2000: $0
2001: $0
2002: $0
2003: $0
2004: $0
2005: $0
2006: $0
2007: $0
2008: $0
2009: $0
2010: $0         # Last zero - kids in college
2011: $35,000    # Part-time bookkeeping (back to work at 45)
2012: $38,000
2013: $42,000
2014: $45,000
2015: $48,000
2016: $52,000    # Full-time
2017: $56,000
2018: $60,000
2019: $64,000
2020: $68,000
2021: $72,000
2022: $76,000
2023: $80,000    # Current (age 57)
```

**Key Insight:** Only 16 working years total, so 19 zeros in the top 35. PIA will be much lower than their current salary suggests. This is the "stay-at-home parent penalty" - even though they're earning $80K now, their benefit is based on lifetime average including all those zeros.

**Critical Planning Point:** If they work until 70 (13 more years), they can replace 13 of those zeros, significantly boosting their PIA.

## Profile 6: Military → Federal Employee (Pension + SS)
**Birth Year:** 1968
**Occupation:** Military 20 years → Federal civilian
**Pattern:** Military (some years uncovered) → Federal service
**Target PIA:** ~$1,900/month

### The Story:
Served 20 years in military (1986-2006), some deployments, transitioned to federal civilian job, will have military pension + Social Security.

### Earnings History:
```
1986: $12,000    # Enlisted pay
1987: $14,000
1988: $16,000
1989: $18,000
1990: $20,000
1991: $22,000
1992: $24,000
1993: $26,000
1994: $28,000    # Sergeant
1995: $30,000
1996: $32,000
1997: $34,000
1998: $36,000
1999: $38,000
2000: $40,000
2001: $42,000
2002: $44,000
2003: $46,000
2004: $48,000
2005: $50,000
2006: $55,000    # Retired as E-7
2007: $65,000    # Federal civilian job (GS-12)
2008: $68,000
2009: $71,000
2010: $74,000
2011: $77,000
2012: $80,000
2013: $83,000
2014: $86,000    # GS-13
2015: $89,000
2016: $92,000
2017: $95,000
2018: $98,000
2019: $101,000
2020: $104,000
2021: $107,000
2022: $110,000
2023: $113,000   # Current (age 55)
```

**Key Insight:** Early military pay was low (under $50K for 20 years), so those years drag down the average even though federal civilian pay is solid. Will have pension ($2,500/month) + Social Security ($1,900/month) = Good retirement, but SS is lower than their current $113K salary suggests.

## How to Use These Profiles

### In Client Meetings:
1. **Identify similar pattern:** "Your career looks like Profile 3..."
2. **Show the earnings spreadsheet:** Walk through their specific gap years
3. **Calculate the impact:** "See how those 4 startup years with zeros..."
4. **Run what-if scenarios:** "If you worked 3 more years, you'd replace these zeros..."

### For Training:
- Profile 1: Self-employment income volatility
- Profile 2: Career gaps for children
- Profile 3: Entrepreneurial risks
- Profile 4: Late-career mission work tradeoffs
- Profile 5: Long-term stay-at-home parent challenges
- Profile 6: Military-to-civilian transition

### Common Themes:
- **Zeros hurt more than people think** (stay-home parent, failed startup)
- **High income ≠ high PIA** (consultant with lumps, lawyer who pivoted)
- **Late career matters** (can replace early low years or zeros)
- **Mission work has costs** (nonprofit lawyer's tradeoff)
- **Military service** (low early pay drags down lifetime average)

### Testing Your App:
Each profile tests different edge cases:
- ✅ Variable income (consultant)
- ✅ Long career gaps (stay-home parent)
- ✅ Multiple zeros scattered (entrepreneur)
- ✅ High earners maxing SS wages (lawyer)
- ✅ Late career changes (all of them)
- ✅ Different starting ages (military started at 18)
